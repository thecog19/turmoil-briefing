## NEMESIS GREEN

Pirate forces are holding the area in which we must deploy our landing forces. This area will form our FoB, as well as denying the pirates a rich resourcing area. Hold the area while we land troops and dispatch any hostiles. 

* Mantain a presence in the area by scoring the four quadrants 
* Destroy enemy forces 
* Secure additional supplies among the rubble.
