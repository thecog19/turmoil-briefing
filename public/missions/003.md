## TANNHAUSER GATE

With the enemy forces in disarray we must move quickly to destroy their primary tools for piracy, namely the ships and storage warehouses they use to stage their raids. This is a fortified position and tight quarters, its going to be a bit of a knife fight. DREAD seems to have hit Tower's mech and he's out of comission, so we're assigning you a new pilot. With Byzantine having been recalled by his organization, you're going to have to do this down a team-member. Best of luck. 

* Destroy both pirate raiding vessels 
* Destroy all three storage depos 
* Inflict maximum harm on defending forces.
