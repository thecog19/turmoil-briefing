## ECLIPSE PHASE 

Bad news Umbrals. The Duke has utterly exteminated team green and is making a beeline *directly* for FoB One. All our logistics and supplies are there, and he can inflict untold damage on our forces if he manages to get there. You need to intercept him, and bring down his mech. Hold the point and stop the Duke and any of his remaining forces. Do this an we'll have completely shattered the Crimson Tears. There are reports that a member of his honour guard has joined the fight, so be extra careful. 

* Defeat the Red Ruin
* Hold the Chokepoint 
* Deal with the honorguard.
