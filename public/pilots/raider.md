Due to its massively dangerous nature, few people in the galaxy become mercenaries, and fewer still choose to become one as a child. But Kell was always a weird guy.

The way Kell tells it, he was an orphan space rat, doing petty crime to survive and stowing away on ships when he needed to escape the local authorities. He says that he accidentally stowed away on an Albatross ship and got t watch a full peacekeeping action take place on some Long Rim backwater. How he got to see that crammed in a cargo hold we don’t know. But he says, and I quote, **“When you see the metal crash together like I did, wrenching each other apart then exploding into brilliant flame? You’d want to be a pilot too.”**

Anyways, Kell’s a weird guy. Always wears a mask, and he generally causes trouble for the local ground crews, but he’s not too bad of a guy. Always buys the first round when we get back, and I’ve never seen him in a bad mood.
