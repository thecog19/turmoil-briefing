Mordoh hails from a long line of nobility known for their unwavering loyalty and martial prowess under the Accipiters. Once great, House Valerius suffered many tragedies both on and off the battlefield, resulting in its slow decline. The once mighty house embraced the values of duty, honor, and resilience since the start of their existence. Trained in the arts of war and chivalry, Mordoh developed a keen strategic mind, a formidable presence on the battlefield, and a strong sense of honor.

The House Valerius believed there was no nobler calling than participating in battle in the name of a greater cause. This belief was the primary reason for Mordoh's opposition to Baron Von Armand after the Baron's desertion. When the Baron left, Mordoh lost many friends and comrades to the infighting that followed. Until he receives orders from an Accipiter, Mordoh has tasked himself with slaying the Baron and avenging the fallen. During this quest in which he has allied with mercenaries or even less reputable fighters, Mordoh asks far will his lust for vengeance justify his actions.
