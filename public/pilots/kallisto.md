Pauperized noble, commanding artillerist, consummate hustler: Nari Anas, callsign KALLISTO, never dreamed of the life of a mercenary pilot, but they're determined to make the best of it. 

Born as a second-string scion in the Anas family, Nari hardly expected to be more than a socialite for most of their life: a dilettante in comfortable luxury, worrying about games and parties more than economics or security. 

The civil war changed everything. Nari was all but cut off, reduced to a small allowance and robbed of the cheerful dissolution they had always enjoyed â€” and financing their thrills and comforts as as a soldier of fortune proved much less romantic than they thought. In the heat of battle, KALLISTO keeps their hands from getting dirty by serving as artillery, trying to line up the perfect shot. 

Between missions, Nari is always angling for funds, favor, or chances to live in the condition they feel they deserve: chasing a little extra on the side, calling in debts, or hanging off someone's arm as a clever sycophant. They might be a little unctuous, but it's hard not to appreciate their audacity. 

## Appearance 
At first glance, Nari "Kallisto" Anas looks like everything a mercenary mech pilot shouldn't: soft hands, a gentle face, obnoxiously long hair. They standing at 5'7", fair and androgynous with dark eyes and delicate features, their hair iridescent green and typically worn in complex styles. A silver crescent plate is embedded in the skin of their forehead, and a silver ring adorns their right thumb. They're almost always smiling.

Outside of their hardsuit, Nari wears flashy clothes carefully maintained from more luxurious times, always careful never to pick colors that clash with their hair. They have a certain fondness for organic motifs and an asymmetrical archer's aesthetic. No matter the circumstances, they always walk with confidence.
