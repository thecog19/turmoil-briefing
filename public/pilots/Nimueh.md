Ma'driin Che has always been fascinated with NHP's. She's always obsessed over them, figuring out how their minds worked and on multiple occasions taking jobs specifically to be able to interact with NHP's. However she's always liked NHP's more than her fellow humans, and that's been problematic.

Her unusual understanding of their minds or construction has lead to a life of problems, often siding with them in conflict, or trying to free them when termination is required. Her lack of interpersonal skills has caused this habit to push her further and further from labs and into increasingly less civilized spaces.

Eventually she moved away from official research and out into less and less legal spaces. Eventually out of necessity she became a Lancer. The physical protection was important, but the resources were better. Most importantly a Mech provided a perfect housing for her creations.

She found the violence, and the violent people, much more agreeable. Bureaucracy and politics be damned when you're in a ton of tech and weaponized brilliance. Who needs Lab Security when you have field testing?

## Appearance 
M is 6'9" of lanky, pale Spaceborn. Like most raised in vacuum more than on a gravity well, she's got just slightly inhuman features. Further augmented with cosmetic cybernetic, tattoos and subdermal implants she projects an air of outcast. 

Long, messy, black hair. Green eyes, and augmented pointed ears.

She wears a hard suit with the casual grace of someone raised a fuckup away from vacuum, and simple punk style clothes.
