The Duke's vengance was swift and decisive. Joined by an unexpected ally in the form of the Duke's former honor guard, the Umbral squared off against the Duke  in the last redoubt before Forward Operating Base One. The Duke's Mech, the Red Ruin  proved to be a dauting adversary, and the forces he had arrayed were a more than ample challenge, but through incredible cooperation, and demonstrating tactical acumen and teamwork, the Umbrals prevailed, with a little help from their now absent friend **Aurelian**, who's parting gift, a small *lockpick* nuke allowed a triumphant, mountain-melting, victory. 

With the Duke defeated, the Crimson Tears are no longer a threat, and AI is quite pleased with the outcome of the mission, earning their endorsement, and securing the reputation of the Umbrals as a rising star among the mercenaries of Rixa 

Of course, the video of their victory has somehow landed on the Net, which has also earned them a small amount of infany and a few fans and enemies...
